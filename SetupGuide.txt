This is a guide for setting up the 'Waste less 1' assignment.

1) Run the mysql script file 'wastelessdb_db' to import the database and values.

2) In Eclipse, create a Java project.

3) Copy-Paste the folders in the project and add the jars in spring, hibernate, javafx folders and the mysql driver jar
to the build path.

4) Run the Main.java file as a java application.

 !If the login fails, set the 'status' value of the user you are loggin with(by default 'Andrei98) to 0.
 !In my version of Waste Less, the reports only keep records of the groceries that have been wasted (haven't 
been consumed until their expiration date). So, if you consume an item and it doesn't appear on the reports,
it's OK, this is how I decided to implement the reports.  If you want to test the reports you have to modify the values
in the database: set the expiration date before today, and when the application runs the item should be 
written in the reports.
